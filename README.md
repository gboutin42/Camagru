## This is my first school WEB project. 

He is developped with PHP, html, css, javascript and MySQL.
No frawmework is used, no extern library, because for this project, none of them is authorized.

## Setup

For setup this project you need to clone this project, have a database launch and edit config/database.php with your credential database
```
$DB_NAME      = "your_databas_name";
$DB_DSN_LIGHT = "mysql:host=your_dsn";
$DB_USER      = "your_user";
$DB_PWD       = "your_database_password";
```

then launch the following command for setup the database:
